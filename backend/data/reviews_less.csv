Furniture classy design (design chairs of XX century masters) and all comforts.
George was very helpful: we needed a hair dryer and he got it to us the first day. Also very nice in arranging times of departure and baggage drop off. Really, super. Thanks",5

Un vrai bonheur, à 5 mn des principaux monuments et musées, à proximité des restaurants et des bars où l'on peut déguster un bon déjeuner grec en contemplant le Panthéon.",2

Ο Γιώργος απάντησε άμεσα, το σπίτι ήταν πεντακάθαρο και όλα ήταν ομαλά. Σίγουρα θα ξαναπάω! ",3
5,5731498,33153814,2015-05-25,4158744,Turid Og Erling,"The apartment had a wonderful location in Plaka and was nice, clean and spatious! We didnt meet George but he was communicating politely in messages and offered transport at reasonable prices to/from airpot/port and the apartment. Unfortunately we did not get the message about how to turn on aircondition and hot water until the second day but his helper came and fixed it.",5
6,5731498,33458512,2015-05-28,9867287,Annie,"George was a great host and very quick in communicating. He helped secure transport to the airport and his driver was very friendly and prompt. Someone met us at the apartment to show us around and give restaurant suggestions. The location of this apartment could not be better as you are right in the Plaka on a pedestrian street and within a 2 minute walk of a back (and less crowded) entrance of the Acropolis. We had so much fun exploring all of the streets of the Plaka and trying many different cafes, restaurants and bars. You have to try the Gyros in Monastiraki Square which was an excellent place to people watch.

The apartment itself was wonderful. Very spacious, full of light and had everything we needed, even a hookah! The Acropoli Metro station was maybe 2 minutes away. We took the metro from the Ferry port which was an experience for sure!
Thanks for everything George!",5
7,5731498,33932927,2015-06-02,30841515,Tracey,"The house was wonderful - clean, well-appointed and in a great location in Plaka. Very close to the Acropolis Museum and the Acropolis itself. A bit noisy as the house is on a busy Plaka street. But this only adds to the atmosphere. We were a party of 5 and would stay here again. 
My only concern is the small size of the bathroom, but this is not major. ",5
8,5731498,34258600,2015-06-06,1929948,Ben,"This apartment was great!

We didn't meet George but his employee met us at the apartment and helped us get situated. It was in the center of all the heavy tourist action (just as we hoped), clean, and looked just like it does in the photos here. All the appliances and fixtures worked well, including the hot water and shower.

One thing to keep in mind: the apartment is on the ground floor and the bedrooms look out onto a busy, touristy street. This is, in my opinion, a great feature! However, street noise might be an issue for some. It didn't bother us at all but it is worth mentioning.",5
9,5731498,34554503,2015-06-09,21784822,David,"My family of 5 had a great experience spending three nights at George's Vyronos St flat in the Plaka. Location was even better than expected in a very clean upscale pedestrian only area.
Very easy access to the Acropolis. The Acropolis was a short block or two away. 
George was very responsive and easy to deal with. He arranged a reasonably priced airport transfer which was a welcome comfort after our long flight. Would definitely recommend our experience to others.",5
10,5731498,34784812,2015-06-12,32072646,Rick,Great location. Very clean. George arranged transfers from airport which was very helpful. Everything you need to see and great restaurants are all in walking distance.,5
11,5731498,35112068,2015-06-15,33278513,Mariana,"I had a wonderful stay at George's house in Plaka. The place is exactly as shown in the pictures, beautiful and impeccably clean. The house is very spacious and it's location couldn't be better. Plaka is one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Athens, with all major attractions at walking distance. George was very thoughtful and had everything organised for our late arrival (after midnight). He also gently accepted my request for a late check out. I would definitely recommend this place, not only for the amazing house but also for its thoughtful host.   ",5
12,5731498,37146146,2015-07-05,4397982,Natalia,"The apartment is located in the best imaginable spot in Athens - on a walking street in Plaka walking distance to several subway stops (Acropolis Museum is the closest - 3 min away).  It has a large beautiful yard as well.  The street stays lively during the day, but it has good windows and with the fan on, one can rest during the day. It is quiet at night. The apartment was clean and had all the modern conveniences.  It has air-conditioning in the living room and one bedroom and a fen in each.  One can leave the door of the 2nd bedroom open for air.  The only major downside is that the bathroom is outdated and small, but the location and size compensate for it.  The host was also very responsive to all communication and our needs! ",5
13,5731498,37626151,2015-07-08,40967,Erica,"George was one of the most efficient hosts I have ever encountered, and the flat in Plaka was hands-down the most beautiful apartment I saw in Athens (or practically anywhere), with huge windows and high ceilings that stream in the sun. The place was sparkling clean when we arrived, check-in was easy, and the location just could not be beat. George was super prompt with answering any questions or responding to any of our problems (even when we stupidly locked ourselves out of the house, George came to our rescue immediately!). One of the most professional and courteous Airbnb experiences I have ever had, and one of the loveliest Airbnb flats I have ever had the privilege to stay in! Thanks again~",5
14,5731498,37754282,2015-07-10,34061966,Katie,"Location was excellent, just a couple blocks from the grande promenade and the Temple of Zeus. Apartment was clean and easy to get to.",5
15,5731498,38432199,2015-07-15,37003377,Long,"We didn't meet George but the driver check us into the apartment.  We dropped the luggage there and came back after the maid cleaned the apartment. Very nice apartment and perfect location next to Acropolis, metro, Plaka street, cool AC in living room and one bedroom. George also helped to arrange a private half day tour to Sounion and transfer back to airport. Make sure good  correspondence with George and his office upfront.  Recommended Appartment and service.",5
16,1108690,4616454,2013-05-15,6108106,Lily,"Just came back from a wonderful trip to Athens :)

The studio could not have been better located: it is in the middle of everything! Yet, I enjoyed quiet and silence when I was there: to me, it is priceless.

The place is just as described and seen in the pictures. It is therefore quite simple, but it has all the basics needed if you're just looking for a place to sleep and rest. When I arrived, everything was clean and neat and Leonidas left a plate of fruits as a welcoming gift.

Leonidas is a very kind host who made everything easy. He was waiting for me at the metro station and gave me tips. When the wifi didn't work, without even asking, he gave me a partial refund.
I only regret not to have been able to attend his concert!

Positive: the location, the host, the silence, the price.
Negative: don't expect to cook or entertain people. Only bare necessities are available. However, it is a very good for value  place!

Overall: would definitely come back :) Thank you for everything!

Great experience and value.",5
22,1108690,5087730,2013-06-11,5068583,Esther,A lovely studio apartment right behind the new acropolis museum. It's a great place to stay at if you're looking for a place where you can do your sightseeing at the acropolis all day. Not to mention that the acropolis station is one stop away from the Symtanga square which makes it very convenient. Coming from the airport was hassle free! Leonidas was a great host too! :) ,5

Le studio etait simple mais propre et comfortable. Point important, le studio est très proche du metro acropolis (pratique pour rejoindre l aeroport ) , de l'acropole et des restos , dans un quartier tranquille. Enfin, Leonidas est une personne charmante et disponible. Bref, a recommander! Merci encore Leonidas",5
26,1108690,5512604,2013-07-03,4248460,Christopher,Nice little place next to the Acropolis museum. Very close to subway station and many interesting (tourist) spots.,5
27,1108690,5551806,2013-07-05,4524561,Christine,"Leonidas is a wonderful host, and the apartment is just perfect for a few days in Athens - centrally located (next to the Akropolis and a delicious family-run restaurant), yet really quiet and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Leonidas!",5
28,1108690,5566993,2013-07-06,5594057,Molly,Leonidas's apartment is well aituated for visiting the Acropolis (right next door to the Acropolis Museum).  Excellent restaurants nearby. It is simply furnished and had everything we needed.,5

30,1108690,5783055,2013-07-16,6135302,Rachael,"I want to give a 4 1/2 star rating, this place is great for a few nights in Athens. It has all of the essentials, bed, bath room and a superb location. Leon is great, he met us at the door, helped with any information we wanted about the city and even had a few pieces of fruit for us. he gave us a heads up as well about an all publc transit shut down which luckily we were leaving Athens the day before. This flat is good for two people. The BEST location I have been for the price, only a few blocks from the main Acropoli metro stop which means right in the heart of old Athens (Acropolis, museum, Plaka and shopping district). The 1/2 star off is because of the futon bed which is not the most comfortable. I would highly recommend this flat and Athens!!",5
31,1108690,5837814,2013-07-18,3611232,New,The apartment is located in a prime location. The neighborhood is safe at all times (day and night). All major tourist sites and restaurants are within a short walking distance from the apartment. The apartment is clean and very basic. The Internet works well. Be aware that there is no AC (I don't use one anyway) also note that the futon mattress is not so comfortable to sleep on. If the mattress was different I would give it a 10 out of 10. The host is attentive and wonderful.,5
32,1108690,5955238,2013-07-23,6990639,Greg,"This a great little apartment! It is right directly across the street from the Acropolis Museum - you couldn't get any closer.
You can cook your own food or try one of the many nearby restaurants. It is a perfect base from which to explore central Athens. ",5
33,1108690,5969621,2013-07-24,4249624,Catrin & Sebastian,"Great location for exploring all parts of Athens. Leonidas place could not be more central.The flat is just off to the Acropolis museum.The apartment itself is pretty basic, but it´s the perfect place for short stays. Besides the futon bed ( nothing for old bones and backs ;-)) I would highly recommend the appartment.  Leonidas is a very friendly and nice guy and easy to talk to. Thank you very much!",5
34,1108690,5994695,2013-07-25,1165452,Julie,Leonidas was the perfect host. His abode is simple and that was perfect for us. He is one of the freindliest and down to earth men in Athens and is also a very well travelled one so he understands the ways and needs of fellow travellers which is to make them feel at home and he did just that. I'm sure we will see him again.,5
35,1108690,6050143,2013-07-28,4554085,Johanna,"Leon is a fantastic host, who is very concerned about the guest's comfort. The apartment is in an amazing location, and is extremely convient to the Acropolis metro, to tourist attractions, and to cafes and shops. I found the bed perfectly comfortable. It was a great pied-a-terre for me in Athens!",5

43,1108690,6512919,2013-08-15,697401,Nick,"Athens was amazing and I had a great time at Leonidas flat. Definitely recommend it for a young couple or single traveling to Athens to see the major sites. Close to everything. I walked to the Acropolis (amazing), the museum, the Temple of Zeus and other cool places. You'll have a great stay. ",5
44,1108690,6532022,2013-08-16,6706665,Michael,"Leonidas' place was excellent for the price and location.  We walked all over Athens from that location.  The room is plain but clean and (as I've already noted) well located.  Leonidas was also really helpful, responsive and friendly.  We acidentally left a bag at the place after we left and he very kindly made sure we got it back before we returned home.  Great experience!  I would absolutely recommend this for a budget traveler.",5
45,1108690,6707785,2013-08-22,3774416,Charlotte,"In terms of locations, you could not ask for a better place in Athens. It is literally a stones throw away from the New Acropolis Museum. Located in an incredibly safe and quiet neighborhood, it is within walking distance of the subway, the Acropolis, and the Plaka area. Another great convenience is a Hop On, Hop Off stop across the street, as well as a fantastic restaurant next door. The flat has newly installed ac that made for much needed relief from the heat. And the apartment itself is the perfect size for 1-2 travelers. Leonidas was a gracious host, and incredibly accommodating to all of our needs. We would not hesitate to stay with him again.",5

The acropolis is so close and the apartment itself is clean and spacious. Id stay here again in a second. Leon is a great host and was profession and punctual when meeting up to show us the place, thanks leon! And for anyone looking for a place, look no further!",5

51,1108690,7073858,2013-09-05,2055695,Jared,"The apartment was absolutely perfect for us. It's literally directly across the street from the Acropolis Museum (one of the best museums I've ever visted) and a 5-10 minute walk from one of the entrances to the Acropolis itself. Also a 2 minute walk from the subway. For those with lots of luggage, there are only a few stairs to climb. We were there on a 24-hour-ish hour layover. Flight got in late but Leon nicely met us at the apartment as promised. The proximity to the Acropolis also allowed us to do other things in Athen that we might now have had time to explore otherwise: like the cool area around the garment district and the plaka. Really enjoyable stay and highly recommended for anyone who wants to be literally steps from the acropolis without a high pricetag. Thanks much! ",5
52,1108690,7088359,2013-09-06,2064158,Carmen,Small and clean Apartment right in the Heart of Athens. We stayed here for one night before we went to the islands and it was fantastic!

If you are a tourist you cant ask for a better place...the location make you feel like a Greek god and you are near to everything (touristic places, metro, supermarket) .

The apartment was really clean when I got there and it had almost everything I needed, the kitchen might be a bit basic (as the description say) but is enough for a short stay.

Ektoras is a really nice host, he was always available to answer me my doubts and help me, he even provide me of some kitchen stuff I asked.

I'd definitely go back again and recommend it! ",5

Ektoras's friend Leon welcomed me kindly when I arrived and they were flexible when I had problems with closing the window (clumsy me).

Leon was nice and helpful with showing us the flat, even though we arrived at the flat quite late (around 10pm). 

The flat itself wasn't very clean, there were a few flying insects which took us a while to capture. However overall I would say it is hygienic and did not cause much discomfort.

The apartment was exactly as described and is in a great location. So close to the Acropolis, Museum, and plaka area. It is also right next door to a great fruit market.

109,1108690,15437267,2014-07-08,10971167,Charles,"Host is Leon, who appeared in a rush to leave as soon as we picked up the key. The apartment indeed is very close to Acropolis museum and there is a delightful, family-run taverna on the same block (To Kati Allo). Granted it's a bare-bones place that is well-situated, but still, 75 or so Euros is a lot of money for the place. The bathroom is small and the shower even smaller. There's barely enough space to crouch and since there is no shower curtain, you end up getting the whole floor wet - which is a bit humiliating. The soap on the sink was industrial and watered down. We didn't use the kitchen, but you wouldn't want to because there only a hotplate. Also, the photo of the Acropolis is a bit misleading given that there is no view. I would only book this place in an extreme last-minute situation, as we did, but even then it gave us the unpleasant feeling that the hosts are going for optimal profit with minimal effort. ",1

There is a fruit shop and a leather goods shop right next to the flat. It was also very convenient to have a place to leave luggage in 3 min walking distance even after we checked out this flat.

It's close to all the main tourist attractions, in fact it's right in the middle of it all! The flat provides all the basics that are needed, but its definately the location that makes it a good pick. If you are staying longer, there are much nicer flats a little further away from the tourist crouds in local neighbourhoods.
We arrived on a flight from Naxos with two and a half hours delay, and were very lucky to still get into the flat in the very last minute just when we arrived. I guess things like this are annoying for both those arriving late and those waiting, but i would have been really annoyed if we got there and no one was around, and I guess these are things you need to work with as a host... Also you should know that the doorbell is labeled with ""Leon"", I'm not sure how we should have known that...
One of the rules of the house is to leave the place as you found it, which is a nice rule, but doesn't really eliminate the need for cleaning after the guests leave unless cleaning utensils are there and the guest is specifically asked to clean before leaving... When we were there, there was hair all over the bathroom, which definately wasn't from us, and that's a bit disgusting...
But for a night it was perfect :) Thank you!",5

Besides, the subway station is 2 mn walk so it is perfect if you have to carry bags so no need of a taxi, you can get there directly from the airport or the Piraeus harbor. The place has the main basic things you need and it is clean and quiet.
I will definitely consider Ektoras's place for my next trip to Athens.",5
148,1108690,21600396,2014-10-20,20464994,Nitsan,"We stayed at the apartment on both ends of our stay in Greece. Both times we were welcomed by Leon, that was very available before each of our arrivals. 
The location is perfect, just outside the Acropolis Museum and a short walk from Plaka and the Acropolis. It's a small and quite apartment, just enough to spend the nights - it is not big enough to host guests or anything like that.
The bath is tiny but with hot water (if you set the boiler in advance). 
Very good WiFi and a useful kitchen for those of you who wish to cook for themselves.",5

 After I booked the place we decided to change our plan and reduce number of days in Athenes and visit one of Greek islands. I contacted Ektros before more than one week from the reservation date . I sent him my request to modify the booking . Ektros  answered me after three days when the cancellation is charged. In his reply, he said he is not there for my everyday needs? It was a very rude answer !!

Ektros was not there when we arrived. Lio, his cousin was there waiting for us and he was very welcoming and friendly . The area is safe and quiet. The apartment ìs ok but not as neat and spacious as you see in the pics. The kitchen was clean and fairly equipped. Only one pan was there. The bathroom was not clean mainly the bathtub and walls around it ! . The towels looked very used and tired of repetitive use and washing. I recommend the apartment for its location only, however, you better find something more clean and comfortable.",5

You are also very close to two of the main metro (underground) lines, so from there you can get to almost anywhere! Dimitris is a great host, he gave us a warm welcome and was available for anything we might need. We would certainly recommend the place or come again ourselves!",5

Excellent communication and he went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed the entire stay!  The apartment was adorable, very clean and comfortable.  The location was absolutely perfect and safe no matter what time of day we were coming and going!  Right next to the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch, and the shops and restaurants in the Plaka!   Would stay here again in a heartbeat and plan to the next time I am in Athens!",5

He provided us with really clear indications to get to the appartement. About the appartement: staying anywhere else in Athens would be a mistake!!! Location is incredible!!!!!! The appartement is small but has everything you need for a short stay. Dimitris and his father greeted us with a bowl of fruits and  a small bottle of some local alcohol!  They were available and getting in touch with them was really easy! 
Thank you for this wonderful stay!",5

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  ",5
218,918812,5294679,2013-06-23,6231552,Loren,"We had a fantastic time in Athens and it was largely due to our extremely well positioned accommodation. The basement room is cool and quiet which is essential if you need a siesta or just a post-jet-lag nap. 
Dimitiris was a thoughtful and kind host. My husband forgot some medication at home and Dimitiris found us a late night chemist and sent directions. Well beyond expectations. ",5

220,918812,5562449,2013-07-06,6229880,Felicity,"I cannot speak highly enough of Dimitris and our stay at Athens Soul. Firstly, the apartment is perfectly located in the Plaka district, so close to many restaurants, and all the touristy things there are to do in Athens. My husband and I stayed at Dimitris' apartment for 4 days and in that time walked everywhere. Even dragging my ridiculously heavy suitcase from the train station (Acropoli) was easy as it was only 5 minutes (probably only 2 if you walk without luggage!) Very clean and plenty of space.

Secondly, Dimitris takes the word host to another level. Communication was excellent - any question I had, from ferry bookings to where to get a massage after my 20 hour flight, was met with ""let me do some research and i'll get back to you,"" which he did within 24 hours at the most (usually half an hour!). The biggest praise (and thank you) I have for Dimitris is, before I booked when I asked him if he knew about taxis to his apartment as my husband was on a different flight and arrived at 1.30am. Dimitris advised us that taxis were very expensive at that time in the morning, and offered to pick him up for a much more reasonable fee! This won me over completely, as it was such a kind offer at that time of the morning! And then when my husband was late meeting him as his bags had gone missing at the airport, Dimitris waited around, in constant communication with me until my husband turned up and dropped him off at 3am. 

Dimitris as host and Athens Soul apartment is the only way to go if you want a hassle free stay in Athens!",5
221,918812,5788874,2013-07-16,6516812,Nathan,"Three words: location, location, location!!! This is a very tidy, cute little apartment right at the heart of everything you want to do as a tourist in Athens. 
The host Dimitris is wonderful as well. He greeted us with everything we needed to know about the place and being a local he can help you out with anything you may need to know about the city as well. The air conditioning was a Godsend as the temperature was up in the mid 30's during our stay. 
It's cosy, quiet and as I say so centrally located to things like the Acropolis and Acropolis musuem as well as being within easy walking distance of the shopping and eating areas of Plaka and Monastiraki. 

Would definitely recommend this place and stay there again.",5
222,918812,5890884,2013-07-21,6802957,Jelle,"Dimitris' place was excellent for its location (around the corner of the Theater of Dionysus and the Acropolis Museum) and spacious room, kitchen, and bathroom. Dimitris was also helpful beyond comparison: he helped us to find places to go and kept us up to date with recent events that would have made traveling at a particular day more difficult (e.g. strikes had made it impossible to take the metro from certain stations). I would most definitely stay here again. The fact that the apartment is in the basement should not stop you: it means it is cool and quiet, while it still has windows to get a breeze in.",5
223,918812,6015328,2013-07-26,6518839,Priya & Michael,"As first timers to Athens, we could not have picked a better place to stay! The apartment is great and within easy walking distance to all the major attractions (turn the corner and there's the Acropolis!), has air conditioning (which made us very happy!) and has lots of room.

Despite the fact that Dimitris was away on vacation (we didn't meet), he was quick to respond to all of our queries and even gave us a call to clarify details. His dad met us outside the train station and took us to the apartment, where we also met Dimitris' sister who gave us all the details we'd need. They were awesome, and his dad even shared a welcome raki with us!

We had an amazing time in Athens, and would definitely stay here again!",5
224,918812,6195713,2013-08-03,6922788,Peta,"Fantastic apartment! Location is perfect - no public transport required, and close to well priced restaurants (Dimitris can recommend some, away from tourist area). 
Dimitris is a dream host - friendly, responsive. Gave brilliant directions and met us on arrival with his lovely father - they had breakfast items for us, and also welcomed us with a Greek toast! 

Highly recommend this apartment - if you're visiting Athens, stay here! It's a cool oasis from the heat of Athens, and life was wonderful staying here.",5
225,918812,6590488,2013-08-18,359109,Leo,"The apartment is perfectly located in the very center of Athens, at 200 meters of Acropolis metro, and near all pedestrians’ streets. 
Before our arrival, Dimitris sent us a perfect summary on how to get to the flat and him and his father gave us a very good welcoming. They invited us to a house made Raki, traditional Greek digestive.
They gave us good advices and insisted that we could count on their help for anything. 
We couldn't enjoy the 2 bikes that go with the flat, as my couple was pregnant, but it can be a good way to discover Athens!!
We definitely recommend Dimitris flat for a good stay in Athens !!

He showed us how everything worked and welcomed us with a toast of his home-made raki.  The apartment itself was just what we needed for our three days of sightseeing in Athens, clean and convenient.  The location could not have been better.  We will definitely stay in Dimitris' apartment again when in Athens!",5

We had our welcoming drink and all questions answered and those he didn't have the information for he emailed to us promptly,he is very gracious and helpful. The apt. Is snug and cozy and just what I was looking for, within walking distance to most everything. On my first evening,with a short walk I found a place to sit,order a beer and look up at the lite up Acropolus. Thanks for everything Dimitris.

The free bikes are a bonus too...Location is excellent - you can walk everywhere you possibly need to go as a tourist. Incase you dont have constant internet or phone access while travelling,its best to email and agree on a meeting time well in advance.While at the apartment you should definitely try some of the homemade raki - and if you drink it thinking its water like I almost did you will definitely be well buzzed for the next few hours :P",5

Dimitris's father met us outside and down the street so it was super easy.  It is also really close to a Metro stop which is also helpful.  The apartment is clean and big enough.  Kitchen a little small but no big deal.  He provided a couple pieces of fruit and some packaged pastry which was nice.  The bed is ok size but it is pretty firm so if you like a softer bed keep that in mind.  He also has bikes avaiable to use as well as helmets and a lock.  Really great place and super good price.  I totally recommend this apartment.,5

Thanks Dimitris!",5

Dimitris and his dad Jannis are great hosts, Dimitris was always very fast to answer any questions we might have had, and always there to help us with anything we needed. 

The apartment is very cosy and beautifully decorated. The main room/bedroom is very spacious and has a closet where you can actually walk in! The kitchen is small but fully equipped with everything you may need for cooking. 

Highlights: 1. Welcoming raki (plus a bottle of home-made tsipuro from Dimitris' trip to Volos), 2. A plate with home-made Christmas delicacies, 3. Two free bicycles (plus helmets), 4. The location of the apartment: very centrally located yet in a quiet and safe neighborhood, in a walking distance from all the main attraction sites, and two minutes away from the Akropolis metro station, 5. Cleanliness: the apartment was spotlessly clean and smelled very nice.  

Overall a great stay in the heart of Athens, an apartment with a warm and very welcoming host. We definitely recommend Athens Soul Apartments, and would certainly stay there again in our future visits to Athens. Thank you Dimitris!",5

We were in Athens for just a few days and wanted to be close to the main sights (namely the Acropolis), and it was a bonus to be so close to the Acropoli metro stop. There are some great restaurants and little shops around as well... just gotta look pasty the touristy ones. :) The room was extremely spacious, warm, and we don't have a single complaint. Thanks to Dimitris' dad for meeting us and showing us around. Lovely spot and recommended to couples visiting Athens for a short stay.",5

Tout d'abord l'emplacement: juste idéal! On ne peut faire mieux, sous l'Acropole, face aux Colonnes d'Hadrien, plein centre et pourtant, dans une petite rue très calme.
Dimitris a pensé à tout, jusqu'au lisseur à cheveux! Bref, pour une escapade à Athènes sans chichi avec toutes les commodités souhaitées, c'est une adresse formidable.
Et puis un petit mot à propos de Dimitris dont la gentillesse est à souligner... nous attendre avec le sourire, les clefs à la main à 02h30 du matin semble tout à fait normal pour lui. A l'image des Athéniens, il est naturellement aux petits soins.
Merci Dimitris, et à très vite j'espère!",1

He is very friendly and met us promptly at the apartment at the agreed time, welcoming us with some raki. The apartment itself was great, and as other reviewers have indicated, the location is unbeatable, just around the corner from the new Acropolis Museum. We stayed here for 4 nights and were easily able to walk to every tourist attraction in the city. It is clean and well equipped, the WiFi works well, and there is lots of hot water. When we return to Athens, we will definitely stay here again. For the price (approx. 42 euro a night), we think this is tremendous value for a prime location in Athens. Thanks Dimitris, and a special thanks for immediately coming to our rescue at 11 p.m. at night when we stupidly locked ourselves out of the apartment!",5

Just round the corner is the main shopping street, way to Acropolis, the metro station and the temple of Zeus. Dimitris's father had been waiting for us though we were a little late because of the queue at the airport. He explained us everything and was very polite and welcoming. Dimitris himself was very reactive and helpful when we needed something. I would recommend this place to everyone who wants to enjoy their stay in Athens. ",5

There was some thoughtful and welcoming food and drink, as well as a welcoming toast with Yiannis with raki!. The apartment was very clean with good quality fittings and furniture and Dimitris and Yiannis obviously make a special effort to make it as comfortable and amenable as possible; for instance there were two bikes available for our use, with lights and locks, and helmets! There were 2 umbrellas! Also the kitchen was well equipped.  We had reservations about staying in a basement but there was a small outside area with very good light and ventilation into the main room, and there were views of pedestrians on the street, and even sunlight in the bedroom in the morning (spring time). It also very, very quiet although only a 200 meters or so from the temple of Zeus and the Acropolis Museum in a residential street, an extremely central location. Above all we'd recommend these guys for their thoughtfulness and warmth (they also very generously followed up on a lost property issue for us). Thank you Yiannis and Dimitris.",5

255,918812,14739633,2014-06-25,14991298,Denise,"We had a great time staying in Dimitris' apartment in the Plaka area of Athens which is the old part of the city. It is a touristy area but very pretty and charming, quite different to what we saw of the rest of Athens. The location is brilliant - it's about 5 minutes' walk to the Acropolis Museum; also to Hadrian's Wall and the Temple of Zeus. The Acropolis is about 10 minutes' walk. It is about 3 minutes' walk from the Acropolis Metro station, which meant we didn't have to wheel our luggage very far at all. We didn't meet Dimitris but his father Yiannis met us and kindly showed us where everything was. He gave us his phone number in case we had any problems but we didn't need to call him. The apartment was clean and the bed had nice crisp white sheets. The wifi and aircon worked perfectly. We didn't do any cooking there as there are many tavernas in the area and we also found a place just opposite the metro station that made great gyros for a very reasonable price. The only slight negative was the fact that the apartment was semi-basement. The spacious main room, which has a double bed, desk, and table and chairs, gets a little bit of natural light and has doors that can be opened if you want some fresh air. The kitchen and bathroom don't get any natural light. However we did not see this as a big issue as we just turned on the lights! Anyway, the advantages of the apartment far outweighed the disadvantages.",5

261,918812,17040240,2014-08-06,8496715,Alina,"Это действительно очень удобная квартира в очень удачном месте. Если бы я показала пальцем на карте, где в Афинах удобнее всего остановиться - это был бы дом Димитриса.
Да, это полуподвал, но по утрам там есть солнце, там все хорошо проветривается, а в остальное время дня квартира не так нагревается даже в августе, мы спали без кондиционера.
Квартира расположена в тихом переулке, нас иногда беспокоили только люди, проходящие мимо вечером и громко разговаривавшие друг с другом, но это было не очень поздно даже в субботу.
Столик, что стоит у стены, на самом деле более удобный для того чтобы за ним поесть вдвоем, чем это может показаться на фотографии. Кроме того, там все-таки есть большое зеркало в полный рост, оно нашлось на внутренней дверце шкафа.
Теплый прием отца Димитриса, фрукты, ракия и круассаны - это очень приятно.
В ванной на кранах перепутаны местами обозначения теплой и холодной воды, и коврик от скольжения там висит не зря - советую обязательно воспользоваться им.
Соотношение цена-качество просто отличное. Мы остались довольны.

There are some free snacks and beers provide from him too, making the place feel home-y as soon as I arrived. The neighborhood is right in the center of all the sights I wanted to see while in Athens. I was less than 10 minutes of walking from all the reatairants, ancient temples, and museums I wanted to go to. The apartment would host two easily, and three could stay there comfortably too. The wifi worked perfectly, and the heater worked great. ",5

The apartment is placed in old building in the historical center of Athens, i.e. the location of the apartment is quite good for any trips in Athens.
There is only one drawback there, the apartment is placed underground (minus one floor), but it was not so critical for me because I traveled a lot and I came back to the apartment after sunset.",5

Dimitris' father, Yanus, met us with shots of Raiki, pastries, and fruit and showed us everything we needed to know about the apartment.  The apartment is partly underground, so there isn't a view, but the comfort and location completely make up for that. Highly recommended.",5

It is a very nice apartment, with plenty of room, a good shower/bathroom and a small kitchen; the place was exactly as per the photos. We stayed in a cold, snowy February, but were never cold in the apartment - there is central heating, an air conditioner and a portable electric heater... so no worries there! The bed is very comfy.
The location of the apartment could not possibly be better. Literally 2 minutes walk to the gates of the Acropolis and right in the heart of everything. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay in the apartment. Well worth the money and totally hassle-free.

It's a straightforward single metro ride from the airport and the station is a short walk away. It's located in a very lively area with bars and cafes on the doorstep and a short walk to shops. We also walked to the trendy Gazi area with more bars and restaurants and the Acropolis Museum and archeological site so it's a very convenient location.

It was clean, well air-conditioned (which was important given the temperature outside) and surprisingly well isolated against outside sounds. It's located in a very busy street with loads of bars and restaurant, yet we barely heard a sound, even with hundreds of people outside.

The apartment in itself is spectacular - I estimate about 100m2 centrally located in Athens, just a short walk from everything we wanted to visit. The interior is what drew me to book the apartment in the first place and it did not disappoint. I think we could have stayed for another week and still keep discovering new things about the furniture, art and details.

I'll definitely book this place again if it's available the next time I'm going to Athens.",5

The location is A1 - particularly for the young (and young at heart) - right in the middle of Athens' most vibrant entertainment precinct - and also just minutes from Monistariki, Plaka and the ancient ruins of the Acropolis. All great!",5
329,240960,25005134,2015-01-05,12661633,Hiromi,"The apartment was definitely THE highlight of our visit to Athens. It's way better than described or the pictures show. We're still wondering why Ioannis doesn't charge more for this truly unbeatable place... First of all, it's huge. Really huge. Great location. Many restaurants, bars, convenient stores, metro station (Monastiraki), main shopping streets and most of the sights (e.g. Acropolis) within walking distance. The flat is clean and cozy with a tasteful interior design. It offers EVERYTHING you need and even more. I haven't seen any other apartment in Athens but I can promise that this is the best one.",5
330,240960,30625971,2015-04-25,30365708,Anton,"5 star loft!!!. Ioannis place is better than advertised. If you are gojng to athens you have to stay here. The loft is better than the pictures provided. You can't get any better than this location. A short walk to Acropolis and all the shopping so close. All the bars and restaurants next door provide a real Greek experience. Ioannis met us as we pulled up and gave a great tour and showed us everything in the flat. Not only was he really friendly he provided water, juice and beer upon arrival, now that is a great host. I highly recommend this place to anybody that wants to have a great time in Athens! Would definitely rent again. Once again, Thanks for a wonderful time.",5
331,240960,31724011,2015-05-09,31236648,Cezar,"Excellent value for money !

The apartment is at the second floor of the building but it has two very modern elevators, though quite small (2 persons). It looks just like in the pictures provided on the site - is very large, very comfortable for a couple, and if one wants to use the extensible sofa in the living room, 4-6 persons could easily share the apartment. 

If you like to party, you have plenty of space to do it (the living is huge).

The bedroom is large and it has a huge bed that could easily accommodate 4 people.

The kitchen is equipped with everything a family might need (microwave, stove and oven, coffee machine, water kettle, dishes and cutlery, glasses, mugs), and even stocked with ingredients and food (pasta, pasta sauces, honey, jam, butter, coffee, a large variety of teas, juices etc.) - I don't know if Ioannis left them there or they were left by the previous tenants. I appreciated the Jacobs bag of coffee that was ready for the first morning (we arrived late in the night and didn't have time to go for shopping). 

The WiFi is free of cost and for those who need it, Ioannis allows his tenants to use his desktop. The speed is high for most of the time. Every now and then, it gets lazy but all you need to do is restart the laptop and/or the switch to get it back to full speed.

The location cannot be better than this - is in the middle of Psirri area of Athens, full of pubs, traditional Greek restaurants, 50 meters from the Monastiraki Metro Station, within 2 minutes walk from the Monastiraki and Plaka areas, 15 minutes walk from Acropolis. It is a bit noisy at night but only if you leave the windows open - if you close them, it's as silent as a church (very well noise proofed). There is a small convenience shop 50 meters away from the apartment which is open 24/7 which makes it very easy to buy water, sodas, juices, coffee, milk, cereals and whatever else you might need. 

The apartment has 4 or 5 air conditioning units and a ceiling fan in the bedroom that make it very easy to control the ambient temperature as you wish.

It's one of the few apartments (and very-very few hotels) that offer large LCD TVs (45 to 65 inches), both in the living and in the bedroom, with SATELLITE TVs (in English, French, Italian and Arabic, beside the full list of Greek channels). It takes a good 5 minutes to learn how to use the system but Ioannis is always there to help.

Maybe the most important thing about Designer's Loft is that it made us feel like home in just a few days.

Ioannis is very helpful and prompt and a very discrete host, despite the fact he lives on the same floor. Whatever we asked, we got within minutes (salt, hair dryer).",5

The studio is located in an excelent position, near enywhere i needed to be in the city. There are plenty of cafes and bars allaround, a s/m 2' away, plenty of delis and 2 tube stations (Syntagma, University) closeby. And, even though down town Athens, it is very quiet.

The descriptions were really accurate and the place was much better than expected. The location couldn't be better. The apartment is literally in the heart of Athens.

We got to the flat during the day and there were directions to get into the building and get inside.  It was a little frustrating to have to get in, I was not getting all of my messages from AirBnB at that time, but Klea was happy to resend the messages and we got in OK.  The flat had pretty good space, and it seems like it is being used just for renting out to people.  One of the window shades was down and the light was pretty bright pretty early in the AM. The washing machine is in the common hallway outside the flat, but we didn't use it.  There are a few quirks to this place, but nothing too difficult.  The location was perfect for us, we wanted to see the local bars and restaurants and the neighborhood is loaded with cafes and bars and places to eat.  The noise would not be great for folks needing to get a lot of sleep and wake up early to hit the sights.  This is a great spot for a younger couple who really want to see what Athens has to offer outside of the touristy sites and locations.  ",5

345,587782,34775798,2015-06-12,3260915,James,"Klea was an excellent host, although we never saw her she provided us with all the info we needed and responded to any questions we had very quickly and thoroughly. 
The apartment is very basic but was perfect for what we needed and not bad for the price. 
The square that the apartment is located in is bustling at night and this and surrounding immediate radius is brilliant for evening eating and drinking - it draws a young Athenian crowd and we loved it so much we were coming back to this area for evening drinks each night as it was better than anywhere else! 
There tends to be a fair amount of noise from the bar below in the evening so all in all I'd say excellent for young people or young couple but perhaps not for those wanting more comfort and quiet. We'd definitely want to stay here again in Athens, walkable to everywhere central and reasonable price.
Make sure you follow Klea's directions from the itinerary not using Google from the rough area AirBnb suggests in order to find it!",5

The flat is fantastic for several reasons, again, the main one being its location if the centre of the city of Athens, but amazingly quiet, for being a stroll away from everything you would want to see.
It is in the Monastiraki section of Athens, really part of the Plaka and all the old markets, the Acropolis looming on the hill just down the pedestrian lane from the flat.
This is a first floor flat in an old, Deco building, with a charming balcony.  There is no lift, but it is an easy walk up the beautiful white marble staircase.
The flat is huge, with a large well equipped kitchen, big double bedroom, two other rooms that adjoin each other, with single beds in them, more vestibules than you can shake a stick at, a living room, one bathroom with toilet as well as a small separate WC, a service room and balconies galore.

382,1116076,33248123,2015-05-26,7975086,Anne,"Tamara was quick to respond to our texts and calls. We found the apartment just as expected, in the perfect location for us, with yogurt waiting in the frig -- just the thing my pregnant daughter craved!
The directions and notes on the apartment and neighborhood were all accurate and thoughtful. We couldn't be happier with our stay! There was an electrical malfunction, and Tamara located an electrician on a Saturday afternoon who came and repaired things promptly. Much appreciated!",5
383,1116076,34127811,2015-06-05,29863818,Patty,"This apartment was even bigger than we thought it would be, and Tamara had yogurt, milk and juice in the fridge for us. The washer and dryer were also a treat! The location is excellent - right in the middle of a terrific area but not right on the busiest streets. There are excellent restaurants and bars just a block away. It was a little tricky for the taxi to find the location, so public transportation is probably the best way to access the space. My adult children noted that there's an excellent CD selection, and I enjoyed the spare guide books left from previous visitors. ",5
384,1116076,35536468,2015-06-20,25927819,Frédérique,"We really loved our stay in Lenka & Tamara's place. It was very clean, very well equiped and very nicely furnished. The good surprise was the size of the rooms : really big and spacious with and XL bed in the main bedroom. Though the flat has no air conditionning, it was cool enough thanks to the numerous fans. 
The location is also perfect : very close to everything (pedestrian shopping street, Plaka, Acropolis) so it's possible to come down for an hour or two, come back to the flat to rest and get away from the heat and got out again later when it's cooler.
Last good point : the very good and very cheap place to eat downstairs, at the corner of the street. ",5

The terrace is simply amaaazing! It's like a botanic garden in the middle of the city! 
House's location is perfect because you can move around the center (Akropoli, Monastiraki, Plaka) on foot. There is a metro station really close to the house so i didn't have to spend extra money for transport. 
In the future i will definitely stay here again!!!",5

The appartement is in a really nice location between different cool areas (both the tourist attractions and new upcoming areas) and close to different public transport stops. Especially cool was that the Filopapou hill was just a few minute away from his home and it was nice to go jogging there in the evening. Perfect view to the Acropolis and the whole town. 

The place had great energy, the room was nice and clean, the bed comfy and the house had a cool terrace. The people living there were very zen :). 

Definitely recommend! A great way to meet the locals but also have enough privacy.",5

He is quick to answer your questions and always willing to help - he even picked us up from the metro the first day we arrived because it was a huge thunderstorm/downpour and drove us back to his place. Then he fed us dinner since it never stopped raining really hard and we had no food/no idea where to go look for food. The room we stayed in was also very large and warm. Wi-Fi worked great. All around very good place within a 10-15 min walk to the acropolis and agora.,5

Space is exactly as pictured. The rooftop patio is great. Bedroom was private and very clean. Bathroom is shared with all flatmates but there is a second toilet right next to the main bathroom if needed.

Throughout our stay, he was generous with his time, food and advice. And one of the days, he even cooked an amazing beef and vegetables dish. Apparently it was his first attempt. It worked, it was delicious.

The room is nice and large, and while the bathroom is shared with the other roommates, it was super clean. There is a bunch of road noise, so bring ear plugs and you'll sleep well.

I cannot say enough about the location, you can walk everywhere from the Akropolis, Flea Market, Syntagma Square, Temple of Zeus within about 10-20 minutes from the apartment.",5

He walked to the Metro station to pick us up, recommended nearby restaurants and places for us to go, and gave us a well drawn out map of Athens. The room itself was enough for the 2 of us. It was hot when we stayed there so we kept the windows open. You will hear traffic if you do that, since it's a somewhat busy street but it didn't bother us. The location is in a non-touristy area so you're guaranteed to see the daily lives of Athens. Also a short walking distance (about 15 at a brisk walking pace) from the footpath leading to the Acropolis where there are a few pretty/romantic restaurants/bars.

His apartment is in a good location and a 20 minute walk to the Akropolis. Overall, I would definitely recommend Christos' apartment. It was a great experience.",5

The apartment conveniently located and  is well within walking distance of all the major historical sites in Athens. The room and facilities are more than adequate and the added rooftop patio is a huge bonus (it's sooo nice up there)!

Pros:
Conveniently located
Comfortable Room
Excellent Host
Fast internet
Rooftop Patio

The cars driving by at night can be a little annoying.

He was able to accommodate all three of us and even picked my sister up from the airport and welcomed me and my other sister at the metro station. The neighborhood has great restaurants, and an outdoor cinema, and is within walking distance to two metro lines, grocery stores, etc... And it was a quick walk thru the park to get to the Acropolis, so perfect! 
His home is beautiful and very comfortable. The three of us fit perfectly in our room, with an adorable balcony to the street. His rooftop garden is so pretty and relaxing, it’s a great place to chill out and beat the heat.
Christos was the perfect host, relaxed, intelligent, and has a great sense of humor. He was very accommodating; offering us Greek coffee, maps and useful information about the city on our arrival.  Christos goes above and beyond for his guests - several times he looked up bus information and was always available and willing to answer all of our questions.  
We had planned to rent a car for a day trip but didn’t realize how expensive it was, Christos offered for a fee to take us on a car ride down the coast to Lake Vouliagmeni and to Cape Sounion, it was breathtaking. We also had the best meal of our lives with Christos and his wonderful friends, seriously we still dream about that food, highlight of our trip!!  Christos truly made our trip to Greece such a special and meaningful experience and oh yea, FUN! Thx Christos!!!

He was extremely helpful in helping me navigate my way around Athens to find things I needed for a workshop I attended.  His flat is specious with a beautiful roof garden, kept very clean, transportation is excellent as it is near the metro and the neighborhood. shopkeepers are friendly.  I was invited to share the aromatic meals Christos prepared.  He was an excellent host .  I I was very comfortable at Christos and would not hesitate to recommend it.",5

We enjoyed the beautiful weather in Athens and had a great location to discover the sites.  Christos' place was clean with a very private area below for guests.  He also has a great rooftop garden that can be accessed and enjoyed.  He had great hospitality and respects his guest's privacy.  Overall, our experience was a wonderful one.",5

The flat is well located, with a pleasant walk throuh a park to access the Acropolis and other places of interest in Athens. It is between two or three stations, within a 10 to 15 minutes walk range. 

It is also very clean, and the room is vast with additional couches. It may be a little noisy but earplugs were kindly provided. 

We would definitely stay there again. ",5

463,1824675,22742958,2014-11-13,5201377,Lucy,"Got to Greece and Christos kept in touch with me and offered to pick me up. I decided because I had a lot of luggage that a taxi would be better off and didn't want to bother Christos. The taxi instead charge me a lot more than he was supposed to, double the price... That's ok. I now learned I need to accept when a host kindly offers something. I got into his place and we sat down and talked for a while about lots of things and he made me tea. He also shared dinner with me which was so nice and so good!  He's a very chill guy who respects your space and doesn't bother you if you don't want to be bothered. One of the nights, I wanted more sleep and de didn't make any noise. He has lots of things available for you and if he doesn't have it, he offers to find it. 

Christos was already going to be a host to someone else for the rest of my trip, so I at least got to be with him for a short period of time and I'm glad I did. He gave me directions on how to get places. We sat down and talked about places I definitely should visit based on what kind of things I like. He even kept in touch with my next airbnb host to have me move out comfortably. Christos is a great host! Thank you for opening your doors to me. By the way, you have to go to his rooftop and check out the things he has made... Really sweet!",5
464,1824675,23012224,2014-11-20,19383964,Scott,"Christos was a great host.  He was pretty much always available and more than happy to share suggestions and give advice, as well as talk about things in general.  His home is clean and quiet and just as described on airbnb.  I especially enjoyed the rooftop garden, which is very private, spacious and very large.  The Acropolis and Plaka nightlife area is an easy 15-20 minute walk and there are plenty of restaurants, and cafes within a five minute walk of Christos place.  I would gladly stay here again.",5

Christos waited for me at the Metro Station, gave me detailed information (while we were having Greek coffee) and then he helped me reach every point in the city. Christos is an extremely interesting man, we talked a lot about the country and he was always willing to help me navigate Athens. 

The room he has, is well located and HUGE. Really big and cozy. There is a supermarket down the street and I felt home -i would say- from day 1. 

The neighborhood is quiet and safe. You can walk easily and be right in front of Akropolis in 15 minutes. Actually, you can go to a lot of archeological sites from Christo's home within 30 minutes walking.

I would definitely recommend Christos as a host when visiting Athens. He makes the whole trip worth it from day 1. ",5

The apartment is also close (walking distance) to the Acropolis and other major sights, and there are many lively bars and restaurants nearby. 

The room is neat, clean, well maintained and Christos takes care of everything. There's also a heater to warm you up, if you feel cold in the winter. The only drawback is that the room faces a noisy street. If you are a light sleeper, you can hear cars and motorcycles go by every few minutes until late in the night. Christos has thoughtfully provided ear plugs, so those help a little.

Other than that, its a perfect place, and I highly recommend it!",5

The beds are comfortable, the house was well-heated (December) the shared kitchen is well-stocked and there is a fantastic rooftop patio. We could walk to the Parthenon and museum (a pleasant walk through neighborhoods and the park) and there were cafes and bars nearby.
There's a shared kitchen and bathroom and living area so there is a sense of community-but the room is private enough that we had enough privacy too. Not fancy but warm, welcoming and I'd definitely stay here again We are two adults and three teens and we had a great time. He even shared his recipe for Greek Lentils.",5

Christos picked us up at Kerameikos Metro Station. We got home in 10-15 minutes. His 
house is situated in a very strategic location not far from Akropolis area. The neighbourhood is quiet and pleasant. 
Christos' house is nice, spacious, clean and functional. Our accommodation was perfect. We had a large bedroom (with two bright windows, a piece of furniture with several drawers, a large desk, an electric heater and a useful coat rack) plus a living room annexed with another window with a small table and two couches.  In addition, there's a large and cozy terrace where we would have our breakfast surrounded by several houseplant and pot plants.
Christos is a very pleasant guy. 
He’s careful, discreet and, most of all, very kind. He cooked for us twice and I must say he's a very good cook too. 
The night before we left we had a wonderful dinner together talking about everything in a very friendly atmosphere. 
I'm very happy I've made the pleasure of his acquaintance and if I ever came back to Athens I'd surely contact him. 
In conclusion, strongly recommended.

Christos si è rivelato un host molto discreto ma presente.
La posizione della casa veramente ottima, in pochissimo tempo si raggiungono tutti i siti di maggior interesse ed è vicinissima alla metropolitana.
La stanza dove siamo stati ospitati molto grande e con possibilità di utilizzo di un salotto, un po' rumorosa per via della strada adiacente, ma sopportabile. Pulizia ottima.

473,1824675,25409667,2015-01-15,17314448,Isaac,"Staying at Christos' place was a pleasure, and really enhanced our trip. When we arrived  in Athens we were a little lost, but after we gave Christos a call he tracked us down and led us to the room. He then offered us a map of the city to borrow and highlighted good areas to explore and eat, answering all of our questions. When my brother asked about the outlet situation Christos offered to go out and buy us a converter. In summary -- he made us feel very welcome!

The place where we stayed was very clean, comfortable and spacious, as well as nicely decorated. We visited in the Winter so it got cold at nights but there was heating and a radiator so we slept well. The adjacent room to the bedroom had some couches and extra blankets. The neighborhood and the building are pretty quiet at night, which makes this a good place to relax.

At the same time, the location of the room is really ideal, right in the heart of Athens. Walk outside and down the street for a few minutes and you find yourself climbing up towards Filopappous Hill, a spot where you get great views of the city, and especially the Acropolis a few minutes away. It's an easy walk to the Acropolis, the Plaka, Psirri, Monastiraki, Syntagma Square, and all those other great destinations. Nearby are metro stops from the Airport (blue line) and towards the port at Piraeus (green line), where you can go to catch a ferry to an island. 

If you're looking for a very reasonably priced and comfortable room centrally located in Athens, I recommend you stay with Christos!",5

In short, it was nothing but good experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking to stay in Athens!",5

He even helped us when our clothes got wet because there was a really heavy storm in Athens. The room is soo confortable and warm, the whole appartment was nicely decorated and clean, we could enjoy our time in Christos living room next to the fire talking or eating (a lot!). We tasted greek cheese and lettuces thanks to our host and learned a lot about the greek way of life and their hospitality.

He sat with us as often as we wanted or needed to orient and help us with our plans.  Christos went as far as to offer to share his meal! The apartment was very clean and comfortable.

Our host greeted us then provided a map and some great information about where to go. The room we stayed in was next door to Christos' room, but we barely noticed that he was there. He provided everything we needed such as towels and a clean bed. The room was a little bit cold and faces a very busy street, so at night we could hear lots of cars right outside the window. There were a few minor issues that weren't what I expected, such as the door to the bedroom is very loud, no shower curtain in the bathroom and the house being a little bit cold. Other than that Christos was an extremely gracious host and location was ideal.  We walked ~15 min to the train station the next morning to catch the subway to the airport (14 Euro for 2 tickets).",5

Das Abholen von der Metro hat gut geklappt, das Zimmer und die Gemeinschaftsräume (Küche, Bad, Flur, Terrasse) waren sauber und einladend gemütlich. Man hat gemerkt, dass sich Christos wirklich beim Einrichten des Gästezimmers und der Wohnung, aber auch als Gastgeber selbst Mühe gibt. Da ich mit meinem Freund fast zwei Wochen bei Christos war, haben wir auch mitbekommen, dass er das Bad regelmäßig putzt und die Küche immer für uns nutzbar hinterließ. Einige Lebensmittel durften wir mitbenutzen oder wurden dazu eingeladen etwas mitzuessen. Er war sogar etwas böse, als er sah, dass wir Beuteltee gekauft haben, obwohl er noch so viel losen Tee von dieser Sorte hatte, den wir ruhig mittrinken durften.
Am Ankunftstag gab uns Christos eine kurze Orientierung und ein paar Tipps zu Athen, weil wir zum ersten Mal da waren und auch einige Fragen hatten. Auch wenn wir sonst irgendein Anliegen hatten, von denen es jedoch insgesamt wenige waren, war er immer hilfsbereit. Ansonsten ließ er uns völlig unser Ding machen und zog sich eher zurück, als dass er für uns immer präsent war.",1

Nos ayudo a llevar las valijas por la calle hasta llegar a su casa y nos guardo el equipaje por cuatro dias mientras fuimos a las islas (ya estaba acordado). El dia que volvimos cocino para todos (riquisimo!!) Debido a que llegamos tarde. La casa es muy comoda. Tiene habitacion y living privado y el baño tambien es privado solo para huespedes.  Es muy recomendable tanto por la casa en si, como por su anfitrion.",3

Property close to all attractions of Athens in a safe area.",5
491,1824675,30084154,2015-04-17,29018749,Lieve,"Kristos picked us up at the metro although his apartment is not so far and easy to find. We felt very welcome from the start. The two rooms were  very clean and nice.   Kristos gave us very useful information about the city, restaurants etc.  he also gave us a map.  His apartment is very  good located to visit Athens, just a few minutes’ walk and you are already in the Acropolis area.
Our children felt very comfortable and liked the rooftop very much.  Kristos is a good host,  he was there when we needed him, but was also very discrete.  We absolutely recommend Kristos and his apartment!

The room was very comfortable, clean and walking distance from pretty much everything we wanted to see. Absolutely recommend staying at Christos' house, even though we were there for only two days!

493,1824675,30464556,2015-04-22,27841733,Brock,"Listing was very accurate and the apartment was very much as shwon in the pictures - wonderful details in the house - I felt like I was getting a very true picture of an Athenian house of this time period and location.
Christos was a wonderful host who went way beyond the call of duty without even being asked.  He accompanied us to two different subway stops and was kind enough to share music from his collection with me!  -- a kind and artistic soul with a great ""green thumb"" and skill at growing plants.  His apartment has many wonderful decorating touches and the location is extremely convenient to both the temples of the Acropolis and Filoppapou  Hill and to the main subway lines.
I would love to return and stay with Christos for a longer stay with more time to explore Athens and hear Rembetika!
Thank you, Christos! ",5

495,1824675,31027679,2015-05-01,22161351,Joris,"We, my son and I, had a very pleasant stay at Christos place. The location is perfect, close to the centre yet out of the mainstream tourist area. Good local bars and restaurants. The apartment is spacious and light with a nice and personal interior design. The roof terrace is great! Christos keeps his place very clean and gives us a lot of privacy. All together I certainly recommend this place to other travellers.",5
496,1824675,31165318,2015-05-03,26405218,Patrick,"Plusieurs éléments nous ont fait sentir que nous étions les bienvenus.
Christos nous a accueilli sur le pas de sa porte à 23h, nous a aidé à monter les bagages et ensuite nous a fait découvrir le quartier et malgré l'heure tardive, nous a accompagné dans un restaurant plein de charme qu'il nous a choisi.
Le logement a bien été décrit, nous réservant de belles surprises.
Le quartier tranquille nous a beaucoup plu et nous avons trouvé quelques rues plus loin des restaurants typiques aux menus savoureux et à des prix très raisonnables.",4
497,1824675,31507569,2015-05-06,26546317,Floris,"We visited Athens for three days with a family of two adults and two children.
We were welcomed by Christos at the metro station and he took us to his house. We had two rooms and could use the kitchen. But the best place was the roof terrace, with all the beautifull plants Christos is keeping there.

The house is in a neighbourhood wich is not touristic, but quite near all the places you would like to visit. Acropolis can easily be reached by foot.

Christos is a very friendly man and made us feel welcome. He gives advise, but also gives you your own space."
